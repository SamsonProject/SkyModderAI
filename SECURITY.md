# Security Policy

Your security and the integrity of your system are paramount. SkyModderAI is designed with a "safety-first" architecture, especially regarding the experimental OpenClaw features.

## Reporting Security Issues
If you discover a vulnerability, please prioritize discretion to protect the community. Email us directly at security@skymodderai.com rather than opening a public issue. We will work with you to validate and resolve the issue promptly.

## Supported Versions
We actively support and patch the latest release on the `main` branch. Please ensure you are running the most recent version to benefit from the latest security enhancements.

## Known Limitations
- **OpenClaw Sandbox**: The OpenClaw automation engine is experimental and disabled by default. It operates within a strict sandbox environment to prevent unauthorized system access.
- **Session Management**: Session tokens are currently managed server-side.
