## 🎯 Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## ✨ Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- **Be welcoming** — Remember that everyone was a beginner once
- **Be patient** — Modding has a learning curve; help others climb it
- **Be respectful** — Disagree with ideas, not people
- **Be constructive** — Critique code and suggestions, not character
- **Be humble** — You don't know everything, and that's okay
- **Share knowledge** — The modding community thrives on shared wisdom

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- Harassment, insults, or derogatory comments
- Trolling or baiting arguments
- Sexualized language or imagery
- Doxxing or posting others' private information
- Publishing others' work without permission
- Dismissing others' experiences or identities
- Sustained disruption of discussions

## 🎮 Modding-Specific Guidelines

### Help-Seeking Etiquette

**When asking for help:**
1. Search first — your question may already be answered
2. Include details — game version, mod list, error messages
3. Be specific — "game crashes" vs "CTD when entering Whiterun"
4. Thank people — volunteers are giving their time

### Help-Giving Etiquette

**When helping others:**
1. Assume good faith — they're not lazy, they're learning
2. Link to resources — teach them to fish
3. Don't mock — "read the docs" isn't helpful
4. Admit uncertainty — "I don't know" is better than wrong advice

### Credit and Attribution

- Always credit mod authors
- Don't reupload others' mods without permission
- Link to original sources
- Respect mod authors' wishes (e.g., "no conversion requests")
