# SkyModderAI — Free + Donations Business Model

**Date**: February 17, 2026  
**Model**: 100% Free + Voluntary Donations  
**Philosophy**: No tiers, no subscriptions, no bullshit

---

## 💰 The Model

### **Everything is Free. Forever.**

- ✅ No paywalls
- ✅ No tiers (no "free", "pro", "premium")
- ✅ No subscriptions (no recurring charges)
- ✅ No feature locks
- ✅ No "upgrade to unlock"
- ✅ No bullshit

### **How We Survive**

**Voluntary Donations:**
- ☕ One-time donations ($5-50 via Stripe)
- 💰 Patreon (optional monthly, $3-10)
- 🤝 GitHub Sponsors (optional monthly, $5-20)
- 💳 PayPal (one-time, any amount)

**What Donations Pay For:**
```
Server costs        ~$50/mo
API costs           ~$100/mo
Developer ramen     ~$1,200/mo
─────────────────────────────────
Total needed:       ~$1,350/mo
```

## 🎯 Why This Model Works

### 1. **Honest & Transparent**

> "This tool is free. If it helps you and you can afford to support it, great. If you're broke (like I was), use it free — no hard feelings."

No fake scarcity. No artificial limits. No guilt trips.

### 2. **Community-Driven**

Users aren't customers — they're **community members**. They:
- Get full access (no tiers)
- Contribute data (opt-in telemetry)
- Help train models (community-owned)
- Support voluntarily (if they can)

### 3. **Sustainable Revenue**

**Conservative Estimates:**
```
10,000 monthly users
- 3% donate $10 one-time = 300 × $10 = $3,000
- 1% donate $5/month = 100 × $5 = $500/mo
─────────────────────────────────────────────
Total: $3,500 one-time + $500/mo recurring
```

**Reality Check:**
- Most open source projects don't make this much
- Enough to cover costs + basic living
- Scalable with user growth

### 4. **No User Resentment**

Compare to tiered model:

| Tiered Model | Free + Donations |
|--------------|------------------|
| "Pay $5/mo for AI" | "AI is free, donate if you can" |
| Users feel exploited | Users feel valued |
| High churn | High loyalty |
| Bad word-of-mouth | Good word-of-mouth |

## 📊 Revenue Projections

### Conservative (Year 1)

| Month | Users | One-Time Donors (3%) | Monthly Donors (1%) | Revenue |
|-------|-------|---------------------|---------------------|---------|
| 1 | 1,000 | 30 × $10 = $300 | 10 × $5 = $50/mo | $350 |
| 3 | 5,000 | 150 × $10 = $1,500 | 50 × $5 = $250/mo | $1,750 |
| 6 | 10,000 | 300 × $10 = $3,000 | 100 × $5 = $500/mo | $3,500 |
| 12 | 25,000 | 750 × $10 = $7,500 | 250 × $5 = $1,250/mo | $8,750 |

**Note:** One-time donations spike with new features/marketing. Monthly is stable recurring.

### Break-Even Analysis

**Monthly Costs:**
- Servers: $50
- APIs: $100
- **Total fixed:** $150/mo

**Break-even:** 30 monthly donors at $5 = $150/mo

**At 10,000 users:** 1% conversion = 100 donors = $500/mo ✅

## 🍜 The "Ramen Budget" Philosophy

### What I Need to Survive

```
Rent (shared apartment)    $600
Food (ramen + groceries)   $300
Utilities/phone            $100
Health insurance           $200
─────────────────────────────────
Total:                     $1,200/mo
```

### What This Model Provides

At 10,000 users:
- **$500-800/mo recurring** (Patreon, GitHub Sponsors)
- **$2,000-5,000 one-time** (Stripe donations, spikes)
- **Total:** Enough to eat + keep servers running

**Not get-rich-quick. But sustainable for indie dev.**
