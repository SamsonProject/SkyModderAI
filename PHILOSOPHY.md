# SkyModderAI Philosophy

## Our Purpose
Modding is an art form, but the canvas is often fragile. SkyModderAI exists to reinforce that canvas. We believe that spending ten hours debugging for every one hour of gameplay is a ratio we can fix. We are here to empower modders with a tool that is as sophisticated and passionate as they are.

## Core Principles

### 1. Transparency First
We respect your intelligence. We show you exactly why a conflict is flagged and how we arrived at a solution. There are no black boxes here—just clear, actionable data derived from our intimate database.

### 2. Community-Driven Development
This tool is forged in the fires of the community. It learns from your collective experience. Every report, every suggestion, and every piece of feedback refines the engine, making it smarter for the next user.

### 3. Responsible AI Use
AI is a powerful assistant, not a replacement for your creativity. Our agent is designed to be a knowledgeable companion that sits beside you, offering deep context and technical insight without taking the wheel unless you ask it to.

### 4. Freedom to Create
Tools should not be barriers. That is why SkyModderAI is free. We trust that if we provide value, the community will support us. We are building this together.

## Business Model
We operate on a simple, honest model:

- **Everything is Free**: No tiers, no limits.
- **Donation Supported**: If you love the tool, buy us a coffee. It's that simple.
- **Open Source**: The code belongs to the community.
