# SkyModderAI Philosophy

## Our Purpose
SkyModderAI was created to solve a simple but frustrating problem: modding games should be fun, not frustrating. We believe in empowering modders with intelligent tools that make the process smoother and more enjoyable.

## Core Principles

### 1. Transparency First
- We're clear about what our AI can and cannot do
- Our pricing is straightforward with no hidden costs
- We explain how our analysis works under the hood

### 2. Community-Driven Development
- Built by modders, for modders
- Open source so you can see how it works
- Community feedback directly shapes our roadmap

### 3. Responsible AI Use
- AI should assist, not replace, the modding experience
- We respect user privacy and data
- Our tools are designed to be helpful, not addictive

### 4. Sustainable Growth
- Free tier for essential features
- Premium features fund ongoing development
- We invest in making the modding ecosystem better for everyone

## Business Model
- **Free Tier**: Core analysis features for everyone
