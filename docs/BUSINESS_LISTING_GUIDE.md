## 🎯 Optimization Tips

### Improve Your CTR

**Low CTR? Try:**

1. **Better headline**
   ```
   Before: "Modding Services"
   After: "Custom Armor Ports — 2 Week Turnaround"
   ```

2. **More specific description**
   ```
   Before: "I make mods"
   After: "I port armor from Dark Souls, Elden Ring to Skyrim SE"
   ```

3. **Add portfolio images**
   - Show, don't tell
   - Before/after comparisons
   - Quality examples

4. **Social proof**
   ```
   "50+ completed commissions"
   "Featured on r/skyrimmods"
   "5-star reviews on Nexus"
   ```

### Increase Votes

**Ask strategically:**
```
After successful commission:
"Happy with your armor port? Consider upvoting 
my SkyModderAI listing — helps me reach more modders!"
```

**Incentivize (without bribing):**
```
"Voters get 10% off their first commission!"
```

**Community contribution:**
```
Post free tutorials → People check your profile → Find your listing
```

### Reduce Costs

**Goal: Reach Tier 3 (500+ votes)**

- Every vote = lower rate
- 500 votes = 50% cost reduction
- Focus on quality + engagement

## 🚨 Common Mistakes

### ❌ Setting Wrong Expectations

```
"I deliver in 24 hours!" → Can't deliver → Bad reviews

Better: "2-week turnaround" → Deliver in 1 week → Happy customers
```

### ❌ Ignoring Messages

```
User DMs: "Is this available?"
You: [no response for 3 days]
User: [downvotes, goes to competitor]
```

**Fix:** Set auto-reply, check daily

### ❌ Overpromising

```
"I can port ANY armor!" → Customer requests impossible mesh → Conflict

Better: "Most armors possible. Free evaluation before commission."
```

### ❌ No Portfolio

```
"Trust me bro" → No examples → No clicks

Better: Add 3-5 quality examples, even if free work
```
