## 📦 Business/Shopping Tab

### What It Is

A community-curated marketplace for modding services.

### How It Works

```
1. Business creates listing (FREE)
2. Community votes on listings
3. Good listings rise, bad sink
4. Users click → visit business
5. Business pays per 1000 clicks
6. We invoice monthly
```

### Pricing Tiers

| Tier | Votes | Cost per 1000 Clicks |
|------|-------|---------------------|
| Starter | 0-100 | FREE |
| Growing | 100-500 | $5.00 |
| Community Favorite | 500+ | $2.50 |

### Example Costs

```
Small business (Tier 1):
• 100 clicks/month
• Rate: FREE
• Total: $0

Growing business (Tier 2):
• 500 clicks/month
• Rate: $5/1000
• Total: $2.50

Popular business (Tier 3):

• Rate: $2.50/1000
• Total: $5.00
```

## 🗳️ Democratic Sorting

### The Algorithm

```
Score = (Upvotes - Downvotes) × CTR Multiplier × Recency

Higher score = Better ranking = More visibility
```

### What Gets Upvoted

✅ Quality work
✅ Clear descriptions
✅ Fast response
✅ Good value
✅ Professional presentation

### What Gets Downvoted

❌ Spam
❌ Misleading claims
❌ Poor quality
❌ Broken links
❌ Rude behavior

### Anti-Manipulation

```
We detect:
• Self-upvoting
• Bot votes
• Vote trading
• Click fraud

Penalty:
• First time: Warning
• Second time: Suspension
• Third time: Ban
```

---

## 🎯 Incentive Alignment

### Traditional Ads

```
Platform wants: Maximize attention
Users want: Minimize distraction
Result: Conflict (users hate ads)
```

### Our Model

```
Platform wants: Users find valuable listings
Users want: Discover useful services
Businesses want: Reach interested modders
Result: Alignment (everyone wins)
```

### Why It Works

We only make money when:
1. User finds listing valuable
2. User clicks voluntarily
3. Business gets real traffic

**No clicks = no revenue** → We're motivated to show relevant stuff
