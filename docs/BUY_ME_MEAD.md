# 🍺 Buy Me Mead — Honest Monetization

**No corporate bullshit. No ads in your analyzer. No premium tiers.**

---

## 🎯 Our Philosophy

Modding tools should be free. Core functionality should never be gated behind a paywall.

But servers cost money. Development takes time. We're transparent about how we fund this.

---

## 💰 How We Make Money

### 1. Direct Donations ("Buy Me Mead")

**What it is:** Voluntary tips from users who appreciate the tool.

**How it works:**
- Mead bottle icons appear in non-intrusive places (footer, about page)
- Click → Choose amount → Pay via Ko-fi/PayPal/GitHub Sponsors
- No rewards, no tiers, no guilt

**Why "mead"?** Skyrim reference. Also, mead is what you drink after fixing your 47th mod conflict.

**Where the money goes:**
```
Monthly Revenue (example): $150
├── Hosting: $15
├── Domain: $2
├── API costs: $10
└── Remaining: $123 → Development fund / contributor bounties
```

**Transparency:** Monthly revenue/expense reports posted on GitHub.

---

### 2. Business/Shopping Tab (Democratic Advertising)

**What it is:** A community-driven marketplace for modding services.

**Who can list:**
- Modding commissioners
- Custom preset creators
- Mod curation services
- Community projects (free or paid)
- Modding tutors/consultants

**Who CANNOT list:**
- Pay-to-download mods (against Nexus rules)
- Stolen/reuploaded content
- Malware/scams
- Adult content (Nexus TOS compliance)
- Crypto/NFT/MLM bullshit

---

## 📦 Democratic Advertising System

### How It Works

#### Step 1: List for Free
```
Business creates listing → No upfront cost → Goes into "Pending" queue
```

**Listing includes:**
- Business name
- Description (max 500 chars)
- Service category
- Contact/portfolio links
- Optional: Preview images

#### Step 2: Community Voting
```
Users see listings → Upvote useful ones → Downvote spam → Algorithm sorts
```

**Voting factors:**
- 👍 Upvotes from verified users
- 👎 Downvotes (spam, irrelevant)
- 📊 Click-through rate (do people actually click?)
- ⭐ User reviews (after using service)

#### Step 3: Pay Per Performance
```
Good listing rises → Gets clicks → Owner pays per 1000 vetted clicks
Bad listing sinks → Gets no clicks → Owner pays nothing
```

**Pricing:**
```
Tier 1: $0.00 per 1000 clicks (0-100 votes, testing phase)
Tier 2: $5.00 per 1000 clicks (100-500 votes, established)
Tier 3: $2.50 per 1000 clicks (500+ votes, community favorite)
```

**Why performance-based?**
- We only make money when users find value
- Incentivizes good ads, not spam
- Aligns our interests with users

## 🚫 What We're Not Doing

### No Ads In Analyzer
Your conflict detection screen is sacred. No banners, no popups, no "sponsored conflicts."

### No Data Selling
We don't track your mod list. We don't sell your email. We don't have third-party analytics.

### No Premium Tiers
All features available to everyone. No "pro version" with extra stuff.

### No Paywalls
Nothing locked behind payment. Donations are voluntary.

### No Corporate Sponsorship Influence
Sponsors don't get special features. Money doesn't buy priority.

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Is the core tool really free?

**A:** Yes. Forever. No catches.

### Q: What happens if donations dry up?

**A:** Business listings cover baseline costs. If both fail, we'll community-fund or open-source maintenance.

### Q: Can businesses pay to game the system?

**A:** No. Higher votes = lower rates, but votes come from users, not money. We detect vote manipulation.

### Q: Do you take a cut of business revenue?

**A:** No. We only charge for clicks to their site. What they charge customers is their business.

### Q: Can I list multiple services?

**A:** Yes. Each gets its own listing/votes/billing.

### Q: What if I can't afford clicks?

**A:** Tier 1 is free (0-100 votes). Small creators can grow without paying.

### Q: Can users block business listings?

**A:** Yes. Toggle in settings to hide Shopping tab entirely.
