```

**Cross-Links Added:**

### **4. Business Hub** (`business/hub_overhaul.html`)

**Phase II Connection Added:**
```html
🌿 Phase II Connection: This is how The Samson Project starts—not with grand plans, 
but with individuals building tools that make them better. When you master business, 
you're practicing the same skills that will restore ecosystems and fund worker ownership.
See the full vision →
```

**Connection Made:**
- Business skills → Ecological restoration
