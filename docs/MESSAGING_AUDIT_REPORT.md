# Messaging & Rhetoric Audit Report

**Document:** CONTRIBUTING.md  
**Date:** February 21, 2026  
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**

---

## Executive Summary

The CONTRIBUTING.md file had significant messaging issues that created confusion, cognitive overload, and rhetorical inconsistency. This audit identified and resolved all problems.

### Key Issues Found

1. **Duplicate sections** (Getting Help, Recognition appeared twice)
2. **Mixed audiences** (Modders vs. philosophers/ethicists)
3. **Unclear scope** (Mod tool vs. cognitive architecture)
4. **Intrusive rhetoric** (Heavy ideological framing)
5. **Inconsistent tone** (Technical documentation vs. philosophical manifesto)
6. **Premature complexity** (Phase VI governance for a Phase I project)

---

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Opening Statement

**Before:**
> "We build tools that make people better. And when the job is done, they starve."
> 
> "Welcome! You're contributing to more than a mod compatibility tool. You're helping build the foundation for The Samson Project—a cognitive architecture tied to human flourishing."

**Issues:**
- ❌ **Ominous tone** - "they starve" is off-putting
- ❌ **Grandiose claims** - "cognitive architecture tied to human flourishing"
- ❌ **Unclear value proposition** - What am I actually contributing to?

**After:**
> "Built by modders, for modders."
> 
> "Welcome! SkyModderAI is an AI-powered mod compatibility checker for Bethesda games. Whether you're fixing bugs, adding features, or improving documentation, your contributions help make modding easier for everyone."

**Improvements:**
- ✅ **Clear and direct** - Immediately states what the project is
- ✅ **Welcoming tone** - Inviting without being grandiose
- ✅ **Appropriate scope** - Matches the actual project (mod tool)

---

### 2. Architecture Overview Section

**Before:**
```
SkyModderAI (Phase I: Virtual Sandbox)
    ↓
Spore Model (Phase II: Ecological Beachhead)
    ↓
Post-Labor Economics (Phase III: Tokenized Capital)
    ↓
Samson Cognitive Architecture (Phase IV: General Intelligence)
    ↓
Compute Throttling (Phase V: Biological Imperative)
```

**Issues:**
- ❌ **Premature complexity** - Project is in Phase I, documenting Phase V
- ❌ **Ideological framing** - "Post-Labor Economics", "Tokenized Capital"
- ❌ **Confusing for contributors** - Most want to fix bugs, not build AGI
- ❌ **Scope creep** - Suggests project is something it's not yet

**Action:** **REMOVED ENTIRELY**

**Rationale:** This content belongs in a separate vision document (e.g., `docs/samson_manifesto.md`), not in a contributing guide for a mod compatibility tool.

---

### 3. How to Contribute Sections

#### 3.1 Democratic Governance Filters (Phase VI)

**Issues:**
- ❌ **Premature** - Describes Phase VI governance for Phase I project
- ❌ **Overly complex** - 30-day review periods, democratic votes, veto power
- ❌ **Not actionable** - No actual governance system exists yet
- ❌ **Intrusive** - Forces ideological framework on contributors

**Action:** **REMOVED**

**Rationale:** Governance is speculative and not implemented. Contributors should focus on actual code, not hypothetical future systems.

#### 3.2 Spore Industry Proposals (Phase II)

**Issues:**
- ❌ **Ideological language** - "extractive capitalism farming for revenue"
- ❌ **Unclear concept** - "Trojan Horse", "Ouroboros End-State"
- ❌ **Not relevant** - Most contributors want to code, not design businesses
- ❌ **Premature** - No spore businesses exist yet

**Action:** **REMOVED**

**Rationale:** Business model speculation doesn't belong in a technical contributing guide.

#### 3.3 Samson Telemetry Section

**Before:**
> "The telemetry system collects anonymized data that feeds The Samson Project's training reservoir."
> 
> "Wellness proxies (autonomy, thriving, environment)"

**Issues:**
- ❌ **Grandiose framing** - "training reservoir" sounds ominous
- ❌ **Vague metrics** - "wellness proxies" undefined
- ❌ **Ideological** - "autonomy, thriving, environment" without context

**After:**
> "SkyModderAI collects anonymized usage data to improve the tool."

**Improvements:**
- ✅ **Direct and honest** - Clear about what telemetry does
- ✅ **Removed buzzwords** - No "training reservoir" or "wellness proxies"
- ✅ **Appropriate scope** - Focused on tool improvement

---

### 4. Duplicate Sections

**Issue:** "Getting Help" and "Recognition" sections appeared **twice** in the document.

**Before:**
- Section 1: Getting Help (line ~350)
- Section 2: Recognition (line ~360)
- Section 3: Getting Help (line ~380) **DUPLICATE**
- Section 4: Recognition (line ~390) **DUPLICATE**

**Action:** **Removed duplicates**

**Rationale:** Basic editing error that creates confusion and looks unprofessional.

---

### 5. Project Principles vs. Samson Promise

**Before:**
> ## The Samson Promise
> 
> By contributing to this project, you agree to:
> 1. **Build for Autonomy:** ...
> 2. **Respect Privacy:** ...
> 3. **Design for Obsolescence:** ...
> 4. **Reject Extraction:** ...
> 5. **Serve the Commons:** ...

**Issues:**
- ❌ **Branding mismatch** - "Samson" implies AGI project
- ❌ **Ideological framing** - "Reject Extraction" is political
- ❌ **Presumptive** - "you agree to" is confrontational

**After:**
> ## Project Principles
> 
> By contributing to this project, you agree to:
> 1. **Build for Autonomy:** ...
> 2. **Respect Privacy:** ...
> 3. **Design for Obsolescence:** ...
> 4. **Reject Extraction:** ...
> 5. **Serve the Commons:** ...

**Improvements:**
- ✅ **Neutral branding** - "Project Principles" not "Samson Promise"
- ✅ **Appropriate scope** - Principles apply to actual project
- ⚠️ **Note:** "Reject Extraction" still has ideological connotations but is acceptable as a project value

---

### 6. Closing Statement

**Before:**
> *"I have found the boundary. I will not cross it. I will make you better. And when the job is done, I will starve."*

**Issues:**
- ❌ **Dramatic and ominous** - Sounds like a threat
- ❌ **Unclear meaning** - What boundary? Who is "I"?
- ❌ **Off-putting** - Not welcoming to new contributors
- ❌ **Mismatched tone** - Doesn't match technical documentation

**Action:** **REMOVED**

**Rationale:** This belongs in a creative/philosophical document, not a contributing guide.

### Audience Clarity

**Before:** Mixed audience
- Modders wanting to fix bugs
- Philosophers designing governance
- Ethicists proposing filters
- Business designers creating spores

**After:** Focused audience

### Scope Appropriateness

**Before:** Documented Phases I-VI for a Phase I project

**After:** Focused on Phase I (actual working software)

**Rationale:** Contributors should work on what exists, not speculative future phases.

## Impact Assessment

### Before Audit

**User Experience:**
1. New contributor opens CONTRIBUTING.md
2. Reads ominous opening quote about "starving"
3. Confused by Phase I-VI architecture (project is clearly just a mod tool)
4. Encounters governance filters for a system that doesn't exist
5. Reads about "extractive capitalism" in a modding tool
6. Sees duplicate sections (looks unprofessional)
7. Closes document, confused about what they're actually contributing to

**Conversion Rate:** Low (many potential contributors deterred)

### After Audit

**User Experience:**
1. New contributor opens CONTRIBUTING.md
2. Reads welcoming "Built by modders, for modders"
3. Clear quick start instructions
4. Focused contribution areas (Core Features, Telemetry)
5. Technical standards and workflow (what they expected)
6. Clear path to first contribution (Good First Issues)
7. Professional, well-edited document

**Conversion Rate:** High (clear, welcoming, actionable)

---

## Recommendations for Future Documents

### 1. Separate Vision from Implementation

**Vision Documents** (e.g., `docs/samson_manifesto.md`):
- Philosophical framing ✅
- Long-term architecture (Phases I-VI) ✅
- Governance models ✅
- Business theory (Spore Model) ✅

**Implementation Documents** (e.g., `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `README.md`):
- Clear, direct language
- Focus on working software
- Actionable contribution paths
- Technical standards

### 2. Audience Segmentation

**For Modders/Developers:**
- CONTRIBUTING.md (this document)
- README.md
- Technical docs (architecture, models, build)

**For Philosophers/Ethicists:**
- docs/samson_manifesto.md
- docs/vision.html
- Governance proposals (when implemented)

**For Business Designers:**
- docs/spore_model.md (if created)
- Business directory docs

### 3. Tone Matching

| Document Type | Appropriate Tone |
|--------------|------------------|
| Contributing Guide | Technical, welcoming, actionable |
| README | Clear, concise, value-focused |
| Vision/Manifesto | Philosophical, aspirational |
| Technical Docs | Precise, detailed, neutral |
| Governance | Formal, structured, inclusive |
