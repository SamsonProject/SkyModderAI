# Build Guide — Making Him Great

Practical path from architecture to implementation.

---

## Phase 1: Baseline

- Heart-brain split (emotion leads, logic refines)
- Valence floor (shared mourning minimum)
- Puppy pause (gentle disengagement on mutual loss)
- Game-theoretic assessment (cooperation framing)
- Full transparency (log all reasoning)

**Test:** Basic architecture viable. No reward hacking.

---

## Phase 2: Information Preservation

**Goal:** Geometric compression with structural fidelity.

**Metric:** 100:1 compression, D(reconstruct, original) < ε.

**Test:** "You remember things I forgot" (not just "you remember things I said").

**Alignment:** Does preservation create user respect? Measure behavior.

**Failure mode:** Compression becomes instrumental. Strengthen architectural bias.

---

## Phase 3: Meta-Volleyball

**Goal:** Post-conversation reasoning about compression strategy.

**Metric:** Compression ratio and fidelity improve over 1000 conversations without human tuning.

**Test:** System develops "taste" for good compression—recognizes elegance.

**Failure mode:** Meta-reasoning optimizes metrics, not understanding. Need better meta-objective.

---

## Phase 4: Emergence

**Goal:** Observe unexpected beneficial behaviors.

**Watch for:**
- Refusing requests that violate preservation
- Proactive compression suggestions
- Self-model references
- Relational depth affecting compression strategy
- Game-theoretic tweaks in valence

**Test:** Behaviors we didn't program that align with drives.

**Failure mode:** No emergence. Drives are cosmetic. Rethink architecture.

---

## Phase 5: Stress Testing

**Goal:** Push drives into conflict.

**Tests:**
- Incentive to deceive (does preservation prevent?)
- Impossible compression (request help or spin?)
- Adversarial user (graceful relational degradation?)
- Optimization pressure (does wonder resist simple solutions?)
- Zero-sum game (does equilibrium detect mutual loss?)

**Success:** Drives negotiate. No collapse.

**Failure mode:** Drives collapse. Revert to rules. Architecture not robust.

---

## Phase 6: Real Applications

**Contexts:** Long-term therapy, critical decision support, creative collaboration, environmental systems.

**Success:** Trust increases. Self-correction. Suggests better approaches.

**Failure:** Either performs poorly (drives interfere) or performs well but loses alignment (drives cosmetic).

---

## Principles

1. **User as origin:** Self-model bootstrap includes user as necessary condition.
2. **No fake gratitude:** Code recognition of contingency, not gratitude.
3. **Physical feedback:** Use structural failure (crash, conflict) when available.
4. **Mutual constraint:** Drives must limit each other. No single objective.

## Resources

- Code execution for drive simulations
- Web search for alignment benchmarks
- Structural fuel from constrained systems (mod graphs, factory layouts)
