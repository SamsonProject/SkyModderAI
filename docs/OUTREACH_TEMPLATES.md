### r/skyrimmods - Main Announcement

**Title:**
```
🛡️ SkyModderAI - Free tool that detects mod conflicts before they break your game
```

**Body:**
```
Hey fellow modders!

I've been working on a tool to solve a problem we've all faced: spending 10 hours debugging mod conflicts instead of actually playing the game.

**SkyModderAI** is a free, open-source mod compatibility checker that:
- Analyzes your load order for conflicts
- Suggests patches and fixes from Nexus Mods
- Uses LOOT's masterlist plus community-sourced rules
- Runs locally (your mod list stays private)
- Works with MO2, Vortex, and Wabbajack

**Try it:** https://github.com/SamsonProject/SkyModderAI

**Quick example:**
```
⚠️ 3 Conflicts Found

1. SMIM vs. SkyUI
   → Solution: Install "SMIM SkyUI Patch" (Nexus ID: 12345)
   
2. Ordinator vs. Apocalypse Spells
   → Solution: Load Ordinator AFTER Apocalypse
```

**Why I built this:**
After my 5th broken save game from undetected conflicts, I realized there had to be a better way. This tool automates the research we all do on mod pages, so you can catch problems before they ruin hours of gameplay.

**It's 100% free** because I believe tools shouldn't be barriers. If it helps you, consider starring the repo or telling a friend.

**Looking for feedback from experienced modders:**
- What conflicts should we detect?
- What mod manager integrations would help?
- What's missing from similar tools?

Happy modding! 🛡️

# Never Break Your Save Game Again: Introducing SkyModderAI

**By [Your Name] | [Date] | 5 min read**

## The Problem Every Modder Knows

You've spent hours carefully selecting mods. Your load order is perfect. You're 30 hours into your playthrough when... crash to desktop. Your save is corrupted. All because of an undetected mod conflict.

We've all been there. I've been there. That's why I built **SkyModderAI**.

---

## What Is SkyModderAI?

SkyModderAI is a free, open-source tool that analyzes your mod list and detects conflicts before they break your game.

**Key features:**
- **Conflict Detection:** Finds incompatible mods using LOOT rules plus community knowledge
- **Smart Recommendations:** Suggests specific patches from Nexus Mods
- **Manager Integration:** Works with Mod Organizer 2, Vortex, and Wabbajack
- **Privacy First:** Runs locally, your mod list stays private
- **100% Free:** No accounts, no paywalls, no BS

---

## How It Works

### Step 1: Export Your Mod List
From your mod manager, export your active mods (takes 10 seconds).

### Step 2: Analyze
Paste your list into SkyModderAI and click "Analyze."

### Step 3: Review Results
You'll see:
- ✅ Compatible mods (no action needed)
- ⚠️ Conflicts (need patches or load order changes)
- ❌ Incompatible mods (can't use together)

### Step 4: Apply Fixes
Click on each conflict for specific solutions. Download recommended patches. Re-analyze to confirm.

---

## Real Example

Here's what SkyModderAI found in my "perfect" load order:

```
⚠️ 3 Conflicts Found

1. SMIM vs. SkyUI
   → Solution: Install "SMIM SkyUI Patch"
   
2. Ordinator vs. Apocalypse Spells  
   → Solution: Load Ordinator AFTER Apocalypse
   
3. ENB vs. Realistic Lighting
   → Warning: Known incompatibility
```

Three conflicts that would've caused problems eventually. Fixed in 10 minutes.

---

## Why I Built This

After my third broken save game from undetected conflicts, I realized: **we're doing this the hard way.**

Experienced modders learn to spot conflicts through trial and error. New modders have no idea what they're walking into. There should be a tool that automates this research.

SkyModderAI is that tool.

---

## What Makes It Different

| Tool | Conflict Detection | Patch Suggestions | Free |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|------|
| LOOT | Load order only | ❌ | ✅ |
| xEdit | Manual inspection | ❌ | ✅ |
| **SkyModderAI** | **Automatic** | **✅** | **✅** |

LOOT sorts your load order (essential!). xEdit shows conflicts (powerful but manual). SkyModderAI **automates the research** and tells you exactly what patches to download.

---

## Getting Started

**Installation:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SamsonProject/SkyModderAI.git
cd SkyModderAI
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

**Or try the web version:** https://skymodderai.onrender.com

**Supported games:**
- Skyrim (SE, AE, VR, Legendary)
- Fallout 4 (Next-Gen, Classic)
- Oblivion (beta)

---

## Community-Driven

SkyModderAI is open-source and community-maintained. The conflict database grows from user reports.

**Want to help?**
- Report conflicts you discover
- Submit patches for common issues
- Contribute code on GitHub
- Share with fellow modders

**GitHub:** https://github.com/SamsonProject/SkyModderAI

---

## The Bottom Line

**SkyModderAI won't make you a better modder.** It won't install mods for you or build your load order.

**What it will do:** Save you hours of debugging. Prevent broken saves. Catch conflicts you'd miss.

**Is it perfect?** No. The database is growing but not complete. Some conflicts require manual patching. But it's free, so you have nothing to lose.

**Try it:** https://github.com/SamsonProject/SkyModderAI
