## 2. Mod Authors

### Template: Author Collaboration

**Subject:** Your mod [Mod Name] + SkyModderAI recommendation engine

**Body:**

```
Hi [Author Name],

I'm Chris from SkyModderAI. First off, thank you for [Mod Name] - it's an 
incredible piece of work that [specific compliment about their mod].

I'm building SkyModderAI, an AI-powered modding assistant that helps users 
build stable mod lists. Our goal is to reduce the "modding frustration" 
factor and help more people enjoy the mods you create.

**What I'm Asking:**

1. **Permission to recommend [Mod Name]** - We'd include it in relevant 
   mod lists when it fits user preferences (always linking to your Nexus page)

2. **Compatibility info** - Any known conflicts or requirements we should 
   flag to users?

3. **Feedback** - Would you be open to testing the tool and telling me if 
   the recommendations for your mod are accurate?

**What You Get:**

- Proper attribution (always links to your Nexus/page)
- Users directed to your support channels (not us)
- No hosting of your files (we link, never host)
- Potential increase in downloads from better discovery

**No Strings:**

If you're not comfortable with this, I completely understand. Your mod, 
your rules. Either way, I'll keep using and enjoying your work.

Thanks for considering,
Chris
SkyModderAI

P.S. - If you say yes, I'll personally ensure your mod is only recommended 
when it's genuinely compatible with the user's setup.

## 4. Reddit Communities

### Template: Community Announcement

**Title:** [Showcase] SkyModderAI - Free AI modding assistant I built for the community

**Body:**

```
Hey r/skyrimmods!

I've spent the last [X months] building something I think this community 
would find useful, and I'd love your feedback.

**What is SkyModderAI?**

It's a free AI-powered modding assistant that:
- ✅ Analyzes your load order and finds conflicts
- ✅ Gives version-specific recommendations (no more "mod doesn't work on AE")
- ✅ Generates step-by-step modding guides (PDF export)
- ✅ Learns from community feedback daily

**Why I Built It:**

I've been modding Skyrim for 15 years and got tired of:
- Downloading mods that break my game
- Conflicting advice from different guides
- Version mismatches (LE vs SE vs AE)
- AI tools that hallucinate mod names

**What Makes It Different:**

1. **Deterministic analysis** - 90% cheaper, 10-100x faster than AI-only tools
2. **Version-aware** - Every recommendation tagged by game version
3. **Community-driven** - Learns from feedback, improves daily
4. **Free** - Basic tier is completely free, Pro is optional

**Try It:**

[skymoddereai.com](https://skymoddereai.com)

No account required for basic features.

**Feedback Wanted:**

- Is this actually useful or just another gimmick?
- What features would make your modding life easier?
- What mods should I add to the recommendation database?

**Not Asking For:**

- Upvotes (downvote if not useful)
- Sponsorships
- Investment

Just honest feedback from people who actually mod.

Thanks for reading,
Chris

P.S. - I'm around in the comments if you have questions. Roast away if 
deserved, but constructive criticism is most helpful.

**Founder Quote:**

"I've been modding for 15 years, and the tooling hasn't kept up with the
