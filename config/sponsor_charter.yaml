## Community Ranking

Sponsors are ranked democratically:

**Ranking Formula:**
```
ranking_score = (community_score × 0.6) + (normalized_ctr × 0.4)
```

- **60% Community Score** - Is this sponsor trusted?
- **40% CTR** - Is this ad relevant to users?

**What this means:**
- High CTR but low trust (clickbait) → Lower ranking
- High trust but low CTR (boring but honest) → Decent ranking
- High trust + high CTR → Top placement

**Community can flag sponsors** at any time. 10+ flags triggers review.

---

## Click Fraud Protection

**We protect sponsors from fraud:**

- **24-hour deduplication** - Same IP+UA can only click once per day
- **Server-side tracking** - Not client-side (can't be spoofed)
- **Pattern detection** - Bot-like behavior filtered
- **Manual review** - Suspicious activity audited

**If we detect fraud:**
- Click not billed to sponsor
- User account may be suspended
- Sponsor notified of filtered clicks

---

## Transparency Dashboard

- Real-time impressions
