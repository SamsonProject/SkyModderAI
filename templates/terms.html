                <h2>Big red warning (plain language)</h2>
                <p><strong>Do not run high-risk automation without backups.</strong></p>
                <p>OpenClaw is experimental. It can break your mod setup if used carelessly.</p>
                <p>BIOS/UEFI, firmware, bootloader, registry hives, and kernel/driver changes are out of scope and blocked by policy.</p>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 1rem;">Use of the service</h2>
            <p>SkyModderAI helps analyze game mod load orders and related compatibility signals. You are responsible for how you use the results in your own mod setups.</p>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 1rem;">Accounts and subscriptions</h2>
            <p>Free features stay free. Pro features are billed monthly through Stripe and can be cancelled anytime from your profile billing portal.</p>
            <p>OpenClaw Lab is a separate experimental tier. It is high risk by design, must be explicitly opted into, and requires users to confirm backups and personal responsibility.</p>
            <p>Before purchasing OpenClaw Lab, users should review the public implementation details and safeguards in the open-source repository.</p>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 1rem;">Acceptable use</h2>
            <p>Do not use the service for illegal activity, abuse, spam, or attempts to disrupt platform stability for other users.</p>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 1rem;">No affiliation</h2>
            <p>SkyModderAI is not affiliated with Bethesda, Nexus Mods, or the LOOT team. Their names and tools remain the property of their respective owners.</p>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 1rem;">Availability and warranty</h2>
            <p>The service is provided "as is". We work hard to keep it reliable, but we do not guarantee uninterrupted availability or perfect detection for every mod combination.</p>
            <p>For OpenClaw Lab users, no guarantee is made regarding local automation outcomes. You must independently review and validate any changes before applying them.</p>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 1rem;">Model and restriction disclosure</h2>
            <p>We constrain automation through tier gates, explicit permissions, sandbox policy checks, operation allowlists, path/extension limits, and audit logging. We publish these surfaces so users can inspect and challenge assumptions.</p>
            <p>Long-term direction may include safer live-improvement loops while playing, but only under explicit permission and strict local safety boundaries.</p>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 1rem;">Contact</h2>
